general:
    bring in FPS.js from other projects, create connection with draw and init
    create a visual interface to control the system through
    Ui scripts: both engine and user
    referencing scripts from other files, tree file structure
    fullscreen button (press esc to close fullscreen mode yadda yadda)

index.html:
    
Canvas.js:
    figure out how to check add canvas to dom if canvas not already defined in the page
    ensure the let command in canvas parameter creation doesn't cause conflicts
    fullscreen behaviour: Stetch, Scale, Maintain size

input.js
    new coordinate system doesn't scale with canvas...
    mobile input capture:  touchdown, touchmove, touchup, multitouch
    gamepad input capture: Button down, joystick capture, tilt capture, touch panel(ps4)

physics.js 
    make these functions better, properly iterable and flexible.
    learn physics, your 11 years old 10th grade math doesn't cut it

animation.js   
    add useful animation functions:
        sprite timing
        transformation effects e.g. tweens
